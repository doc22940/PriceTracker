* How to Add support for more stores
    
    The scraper class is located in pricechecker.utils, Currently I have a function for Konga and Jumia.
    You can add other methods to that class.
    
    After adding a new method for a store, you will need to add it to the store choice in Item model located in pricechecker.model and get_item_data method in pricechecker.utils

_Also refer to the [Documentation](https://store-tracker.herokuapp.com/api/docs/swagger/) for more details_
